# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-SYSTEM
The task of segmenting brain tumors in medical image processing is critical but 
challenging. Traditional methods that rely on manual classification may lead to inaccuracies in 
prediction and diagnosis, especially when dealing with a large amount of data. Additionally, brain 
tumors have a wide range of appearances and can be difficult to distinguish from normal tissues, 
making it a daunting task to extract tumor regions from images. Automated brain tumor 
segmentation methods have been developed to overcome these challenges. These methods rely on 
advanced algorithms that can accurately distinguish between tumor and normal tissue based on 
various features and characteristics. These features may include intensity, texture, shape, and 
location. This paper presents a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) based Brain 
Tumor Detection System for binary classification of 2D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
images. The model was trained and tested on a dataset of 3300 2D MRI images and a scalable 
user-friendly interface is developed using streamlit. We have taken various MRI images with 
diverse tumor sizes, locations, shapes, and different image intensities to train the model. We have 
implemented our proposed method using “TensorFlow” and “Keras” in “Python” as an efficient 
programming language to perform fast work. The model achieved an accuracy of up to 98%. The 
proposed system provides an efficient, accurate and automated way of diagnosing brain tumors. 
Furthermore, it can be used as a convenient diagnostic system in clinical settings and can help 
reduce the diagnosis time significantly. The results of this work suggest that the proposed system 
can be used as a reliable tool for automated detection of brain tumors. It has potential implications 
in medical diagnosis and could help in early identification of brain tumors.
